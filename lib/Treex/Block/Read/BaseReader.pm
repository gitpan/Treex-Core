=head1 NAME

Treex::Block::Read::BaseReader - abstract ancestor for document readers

=head1 VERSION

version 0.08330_1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class serves as an common ancestor for document readers,
that have a parameter C<from> with a space or comma separated list of filenames
to be loaded.
It is designed to implement the L<Treex::Core::DocumentReader> interface.

In derived classes you need to define the C<next_document> method,
and you can use C<next_filename> and C<new_document> methods.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item from (required)

space or comma separated list of filenames, or C<-> for STDIN

An '@' directly in front of a file name causes this file to be interpreted as a file
list, with one file name per line, e.g. '@filelist.txt' causes the reader to open
'filelist.txt' and read a list of files from it. File lists may be arbitrarily 
mixed with regular files in the parameter. 

(If you use this method via API you can specify a string array reference or a
L<Treex::Core::Files> object.)

=item file_stem (optional)

How to name the loaded documents.
This attribute will be saved to the same-named
attribute in documents and it will be used in document writers
to decide where to save the files.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item next_document

This method must be overridden in derived classes.
(The implementation in this class just issues fatal error.)

=item next_filename

returns the next filename (full path) to be loaded
(from the list specified in the attribute C<from>)

=item new_document($load_from?)

Returns a new empty document with pre-filled attributes
C<loaded_from>, C<file_stem>, C<file_number> and C<path>
which are guessed based on C<current_filename>.

=item current_filename

returns the last filename returned by C<next_filename> 

=item is_next_document_for_this_job

Is the document that will be returned by C<next_document>
supposed to be processed by this job?
This is relevant only in parallel processing,
where each job has a different C<$jobnumber> assigned.

=item number_of_documents

Returns the number of documents that will be read by this reader.
If C<is_one_doc_per_file> returns C<true>, then the number of documents
equals the number of files given in C<from>.
Otherwise, this method returns C<undef>.
